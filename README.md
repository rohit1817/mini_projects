# mini_projects
Welcome to the "Mini Projects" repository! This collection of Python mini projects serves as a showcase of my coding journey and exploration of different programming concepts. Here, you'll find a variety of small yet meaningful applications, utilities, and scripts developed using Python and Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.
